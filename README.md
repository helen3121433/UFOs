# UFOs

## Overview of Project
- The purpose of this project is to create to a webpage for Dana. In this webpage, it contains a big table data of UFO sighting infomations. we build a table using data stored in JavasCript. We also create filters that will react what user input. The user can input date, city, state, country and/or shape to get their result. 

## Results
- User of this webpage may enter date, city, state, country or shape to find result. The filter function will read each input and compare with the table data, then build the table result.
User may input date to find all result in that date, or input city to see all UFO sighting in that city, or input all to found a more accurate one.




## Summary
- Drawback
    - When user entered their element, it needs to be exactly match what they're looking. For example, if they seach for city "benton", it has to input all in lower case. If seach by "BENTON", not result will be found.

- Recommnedations
    - Resolved the drawback pointed out above. User can type in the word with lowercase, uppercase or other special character, and still gets the most match result.

    - We can maybe add a drop-down list for each filter section. So that user can choose from the list instead typing in the word. 

    - Add a nearly location option. Webpage can suggested locations filter based on user's current locations. For example, if the user is in San Francisco, CA, then they can click "found UFO sighting in 10/50/100 miles near my current locations".
